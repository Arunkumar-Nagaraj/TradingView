==========================================   Analysis and Execution     ==========================================

GUI Scenarios :-
    As per task provided user must be logged in to the provided application.

    Based on Analysis of the Task
    * Reviewed the flows in  - login.dev.qa-experience.com
    * The possible flows to automate login and invalid login validations
    * Once the flow and process of automation is identified next step is identify tools and tech stack's needs to be used
    * Then as per the task I perfered to go with Selenium - Java Framework for GUI Automation
    * Now, Tool and Tech Stack is confirmed now folder structure and control flows needs to analysed and implemented
            [ like Where to pick urls,locators,testData, features files and POM pattern ]
    * Once above is point is completed now boilerplate is ready
    * Now, based on 2nd Point we can write our Test Suite

Frameworks Features :
* GUI Automation based on Selenium-Java
* Basic and Advanced Cucumber Reporting
* Boilerplate of jenkins integration is incorporated
* Integrated with GitHub Actions for general testing
            * When there is push operation there needs a basic checkpoint nothing is breaking framework
            * For above point integrated with Selenium with Maven Workflow
            * Everytime when push operation is performed automated build check triggered.
            * Able to View the Test Results in same action.

Area of Improvements :

 Test Suite  :-
   * Test Suite is not constant unit it timely evolve parameter based on our products features
   * We need to have regular catchup Dev and BA to cover the most of workflows
   * To Complete the task i have created few workflows in GUI and API

 Framework :-
  * Current framework it has only whatever required for Task
  * Many more basic methods ,Reporting and Analysis functionality need to be incorporated

  Improvements for Framework :-

  * Centralized Jenkins integration
  * Centralized Reporting Functionality
  * Automated Test Report Analyser
  * Integration with API/MOBILE and DESKTOP automation tools is possible

  Note : Above are few items and many more features can be integrated
